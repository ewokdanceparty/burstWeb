# burstWeb

Run app.py to start the server to visualize the data, explained below. If you want to run the server locally, change the second-to-last line, app.run_server(debug=False), to app.run_server(8001), and go to 127.0.0.1:8001 in a web browser.


This is a web-based interactive visualization of burst spiking, as sensed intra- and extracellularly. 
It uses Plotly Dash, and this code was initially based off of the "Drug Discovery Demo" from Plotly
Dash.
